## Summary

Machine learning models have become too complex as a result of closely following the entites within the sample set, and so although more observations can be accounted for the overfitting nature means that the model will fail to replicate its performance on an unseen dataset i.e. the real world. On a macrolevel, an investor stands to lose on their portfolio value if this is the case. *Thus a way to **successfully** reduce the inehrent complexity of ML models and thereby improve the potential return of the investors portfolio is key to long term success for investors*.

This project utilises machine learning concepts written in Python via the machine learning platoform sklearn. Metaheuristic algorithm **Particle Swarm Optimisation** (PSO) was developed in order to enhance the classification accuracy of the baseline machine learning model - **Random Forest**. The program also has further functionality as a filesystem which the manages the results of user testing by providing two distinct user views of the system with different abilities granted to each type of user.
